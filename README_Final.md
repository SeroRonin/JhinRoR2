### This mod was created under Riot Games' "Legal Jibber Jabber" policy using assets owned by Riot Games.  Riot Games does not endorse or sponsor this project.


## Credits
* Riot Games: Jhin (Character assets including Models, Textures, SFX, and a majority of Animations)
* TimeSweeper: HenryTutorial (Base from which this mod was built off of)
* Lemonlust: Sett Survivor (referenced this mod a lot to help me learn RoR2 modding )
* EnforcerGang: Rocket Survivor (referenced code for custom missle prefab spawning)

## To Do
* Balancing
* Alt secondary ability based on Lotus Traps
* Make Ult Execute group with base damage
* Ult rocket jumping?
* Emote and Vo systems (via Lemonlust survivors)
* Custom VFX
* Other skins + Hopoo-eqsue skin (Project with flat textures?)
* Achievments + Unlockable criteria (other abilties, skins, etc)
* Test multiplayer functionality

## Known Issues
`Bug reports can be reported under Github Issues, or through my Discord: [NOT CREATED YET]
* Ult VFX sometimes does not appear
* Ult applies execute damage as an additional instance of damage (this is due to explosions not supporting post-hit pre-damage modifications)
* Heresy items permanently interrupt reload if cast during a 4th shot reload. Can be fixed by casting any other ability
* Shuriken is triggered very sparsely
* (Unknown, happened once) Skin gets set to default randomly, but SFX stays intact, meaning skin index does not change
