Implement Ult Rocketjumping
Implement Ult VFX models (system done, Project Gun Overlay done, SKTT1 Wings, DWG Wings done)
Implement Dynamic SFX for bullet hits, W hits, and Ult projectile (travel and explosion)
Implement Character/Skin VFX models and materials (Project Mask done, ShanHai cloak, Empyrean RGB, Soul Fighter wisps)
- Modifications to base hopoo shader? ShanHai cloak would probably need it
Brainstorm on how to make Deadly Flourish better
- Idea: Passes through small enemies, stops on large ones. More damage to balance out
- Experiment: Moving while casting Deadly Flourish
Experiment: Alternate Abilty - Traps, trigger when enemy approaches, slows and marks, then explodes
- Idea: Traps arm after set time, allowing them to be thrown into the air. If they hit a surface, they attach to it. If they are triggered midair, they attach to the creature that triggered them. 
- Idea: Death explosions on elites
- Idea: Traps can be shot to detonate immediately
- Idea: Traps can be used to blast jump
Experiment: Dark Cosmic
