Jhinmod temp readme

To DO:
- number tweaking for balance
- Alt secondary ability based on Lotus Traps
- Make Ult Execute group with base damage
- Ult rocket jumping?
- Emote and Vo systems (via Lemonlust survivors)
- Custom VFX
- Other skins + Hopoo-eqsue skin (Project with flat textures?)

- Achievments + Unlockable criteria (other abilties, skins, etc)
- Test multiplayer functionality

Non-standard Features:
- Dynamic skin-based SFX

Known Bugs:
- Ult VFX sometimes does not appear
- Ult applies execute damage as an additional instance of damage (this is due to explosions not supporting post-hit pre-damage modifications)
- Heresy items permanently interrupt reload if cast during a 4th shot reload. Can be fixed by casting any other ability
