###### Jhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.

Jhin as a survivor is meant to deliver a low APM, high damage experience. He has high damage scaling, but lacks sufficient means to deal with large groups of enemies. 

I am by no means a RoR2 Guru, so things are likely to be either under or overpowered. If you have any concerns or feedback, please feel free to reach out via a discord channel I made specifically for things like this: [https://discord.gg/RSs2kA7yRu](https://discord.gg/RSs2kA7yRu)

![Passive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8404018/230709520-79a582e6-462b-4c6f-951b-4082b7bda6a9.png)

<details>
<summary> Passive </summary>
Jhin has a unique interaction with Attack Speed. Unlike other survivors, he gains attack speed with levels, but he CANNOT gain any from other sources. Instead, bonus attack speed increases his base damage, as well as granting Jhin additional movespeed when he lands a critical hit.
</details>

#

![Primary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8404018/230709524-f699f6a2-c95b-4212-b7df-4aef63810f4b.png)

Whisper has a unique ammo and reload system, utilizing shots represented by the tally marks and a reload timer represented by the ring. Jhin reloads after the 4th shot, or after 10 seconds without firing. Casting any skill will reset the automatic reload timer and interrupt a reload when you have bullets left.
</details>

#

![Secondary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8404018/230709534-978b6487-57ec-457a-84b3-f44407873e28.png)

<details>
<summary> Secondary </summary>
Dancing Grenade functions similarly to Huntress' Glaive, but it prioritizes new enemies over enemies it has already hit.
</details>

#

![Utility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8404018/230709539-6bbd4916-2176-46a6-9819-983a8a9fd220.png)

Deadly Flourish is a simple beam attack that stuns every enemy it hits. It triggers Jhin's passive as if he had landed a crit, with double the duration. Additionally, any marked enemies are rooted.
</details>

Curtain Call is a primary skill override, like that of Railgunner's scope. For 10 seconds, it replaces Whisper with 4 shots that deal massive AOE damage. It automatically reloads Whisper as well, so you don't have to worry about reloading after firing all 4 shots.

**The wording on the execute is wrong, and has since been fixed (up to 300% bonus damage based on missing health, or 3% per 1%)

### Skins
> Each skin supports unique SFX and VFX. Creating these assets for each is a painfully tedious process, and as such, only a few skins will have support. The others will only be added if I find the motivation to do so.

| Mod 			  | Compatibility | Notes |
|:----------------|-------------- |--------------------|
| Risk of Options | <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/source/microsoft/74/heavy-check-mark_2714.png" width="15px" /> | |
| CustomEmoteAPI  | <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/source/microsoft/74/heavy-check-mark_2714.png" width="15px" /> | Emotes look a little janky on skins with cloaks. I might try adding dynamics bones in the future to lessen the severity. |

## Known Issues
> Bugs can be reported under Github Issues, or through my Discord: [https://discord.gg/RSs2kA7yRu](https://discord.gg/RSs2kA7yRu)
* **[Skill]** Ult applies execute damage as an additional instance of damage (this is due to explosions not supporting post-hit pre-damage modifications)
* **[Item]** Shuriken is triggered very sparsely, rather than on every primary attack. Likely due to custom ammo system?

## To Do
* Better Movespeed Buff Icon
* Custom Indicator for Dancing Grenade
* Make Ult Execute group with base damage
* Ult rocket jumping?
* Hopoo-eqsue/RoR2-friendly skin
* Achievments + Unlockable criteria (other abilties, skins, etc)

[^skinDynamics]:
    There is also config options to override which set of SFX or VFX to use in the config. This does not require a restart.
[^itemDisplay]:
    Some items with minimal or lackluster visuals, such as Leeching Seed, are simply hidden. I simply could not find extra space to place certain items without non-sensically placing them around the cloak.
[^altAbility]:
    The planned ability would have jhin place down his traps, which would function as expected.
    Additionally, I want to implement shooting the traps to detonate the instantly, pushing the player back if they are close enough.
[^armorFootnote]:
    Jhin does not have any armor at the moment, but I may add some later, should his lack of mobility be too punishing. All stats can be modified via Config, but require a restart to take effect
[^darkcosmic]:
    As far as I know, skins in RoR2 do not support custom animation overrides, so unfortunately Dark Cosmic Jhin is not possible without a duplicate survivor, due to it's unique animation set. It may be possible to create a custom version that uses the default animations, but it may not look very appealing and as such will not be entertained until there is nothing else to do
